         <h2>Restaurant concept</h2>
         <br>
         <p>"Taste of Home" means more than just the flavor of the food; it's the warmth of home.<br>
            People living away from home often miss home-cooked mealsâ€”that bowl of hot soup, that simple plate of scrambled eggs, which carry a sense of security and love.<br>
            Our philosophy is: No matter where you come from, no matter how busy or tired you are, you can enjoy the warmth of home here.
         </p>

         <h2>Founding story</h2>
         <br>
         <p>When I was little, my mother would always prepare a bowl of hot soup and a few simple dishes filled with love for the table. As I grew up and left home, I realized that the most elusive flavor in the world is "the taste of my mother." Therefore, we wanted to open a restaurant not to pursue luxury or sophistication, but to use the most homely and familiar ingredients to create that comforting flavor.<br>
            Every dish here has a story:<br>
            Scrambled eggs with tomatoes is the quickest way to warm up after school;<br>
            Pork rib soup is the product of my mother's patient stew;<br>
            Stir-fried rice noodles are the most lively flavor at family gatherings.<br>
            We hope that everyone who enters our restaurant will not only be satisfied, but also feel like they are returning home, surrounded by love.
